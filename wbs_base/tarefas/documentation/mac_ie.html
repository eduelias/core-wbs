<h1 class="module_title">Why does the page flicker with IE on a Mac?</h1>
<div class="module_content"><p>No one has asked this yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone does soon: I'm on a Mac using Internet Explorer, why does the screen flicker when I expand the task tree? This didn't happen in version 1.0.</p>

<p>In version 1.0 all tasks in a tree were loaded into the page at once. This made viewing large task trees very slow in both transfer and rendering - and we were loading a bunch of information that may not even be needed. In version 1.5 we use a hidden iframe to dynamically load branches of the task tree as they are requested. For some reason, in the Mac version of IE this causes the screen to flicker. I suggest using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/">Camino</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari">Safari</a> as both of them are much nicer browsers anyway. If you really want to use IE on Mac, you may want to stay with version 1.0.</p>
