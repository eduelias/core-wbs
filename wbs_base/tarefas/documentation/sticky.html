<div class="module_content">
<p>Basically: if you want a task to stay visible after it has been completed you can use the push-pin <img src="images/icon_container.gif" alt="Sticky Task" align="abs_bottom" /> to make the task &quot;sticky&quot;.</p>

<p>Sometimes a task is ongoing and it is not fully complete, even when its sub-tasks are all completed or the current status is 100%. Or perhaps, you have completed the task in question but you want to remember to go back and check on it again later. Making a task &quot;sticky&quot; means it will still show up on the Home screen (if it is a root task) and in the task tree.</p>

<!--
<p>Why would you want to use this? There are several scenarios where this is useful. For example, you might have a task &quot;My Web Site&quot; with a sub-task of &quot;Enhancements&quot; which has individual sub-tasks for enhancements you have planned for your web site. You choose to make both &quot;My Web Site&quot; and &quot;Enhancements&quot; sticky tasks so that as their sub-tasks are completed, they are still available in the standard views so that new sub-tasks can be added to them.</p>

<p>In the screenshot of this example below (addimage), you can see that both the &quot;My Web Site&quot; task and the &quot;Enhancements&quot; task are sticky tasks.</p>
