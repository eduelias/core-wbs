<!-- Original:  Sandeep V. Tamhankar (stamhankar@hotmail.com) -->
<!-- Changes:
/* 1.1.4: Fixed a bug where upper ASCII characters (i.e. accented letters
international characters) were allowed.

1.1.3: Added the restriction to only accept addresses ending in two
letters (interpreted to be a country code) or one of the known
TLDs (com, net, org, edu, int, mil, gov, arpa), including the
new ones (biz, aero, name, coop, info, pro, museum).  One can
easily update the list (if ICANN adds even more TLDs in the
future) by updating the knownDomsPat variable near the
top of the function.  Also, I added a variable at the top
of the function that determines whether or not TLDs should be
checked at all.  This is good if you are using this function
internally (i.e. intranet site) where hostnames don't have to 
conform to W3C standards and thus internal organization e-mail
addresses don't have to either.
Changed some of the logic so that the function will work properly
with Netscape 6.

1.1.2: Fixed a bug where trailing . in e-mail address was passing
(the bug is actually in the weak regexp engine of the browser; I
simplified the regexps to make it work).

1.1.1: Removed restriction that countries must be preceded by a domain,
so abc@host.uk is now legal.  However, there's still the 
restriction that an address must end in a two or three letter
word.

1.1: Rewrote most of the function to conform more closely to RFC 822.
